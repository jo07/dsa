    "> Heap is a tree data structure where each element is greater than both of it's children if its a max heap and less than the children for a min heap. It's balanced as in the depth of left node and right node are never greater than one. And the elements are inserted at the end of the array. Oh did I mention heaps are stored as arrays? That's cause every parent's have child at position 2k and 2k+1 if parent has the index 'k'. And to get the parent of a child you just divide by 2. So once an element is inserted you need to maintain the heap property by swapping the elements till we get a proper heap again. Since it's a binary tree and there are at max log(n) swaps needed it has a time complexity of.... you guessed it, log(n). This function is conincidently called the 'heapify' function in all the resources I checked."
