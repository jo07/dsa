# DSA

### I'll be using this repo to brush up my DSA skills, which is pathetic as I type this and I'll try to implement most of these data structures by myself to get a better grasp of the data structure and the most common algorithms using those data structures. This repo will contain basic intro to data structures and algorithms along with its minimalistic implementation and my passive comments. Nothing too crazy!

*PS : This is definitely not how you are supposed to make comments on your code base but since it's not a collaboration nor am I doing something pathbreaking which is not available elsewhere so if you happen to check this out, please don't mind the comments*

Data needs to be stored, processed and accessed in any system and we want it to be fast and efficient. Data structures allow data to be stored in a specific manner which makes these systmes fast and efficient. We need to learn about the basic data structures commonly used algorithms to process the data in those data structures to know what to use where and why. 

In this repo we will get started with the most basic data structures  like arrays, list, tuple and dictionary etc. We will implement more advanced data structures like queues, stacks and trees in python programming language. We will also look at some of the basic algorithms like search, sort and recursion etc
