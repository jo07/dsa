### This repo will contain basic intro to data structures and algorithms along with its minimalistic implementation. Nothing too crazy!


Data needs to be stored, processed and accessed in any system and we want it to be fast and efficient. Data structures allow data to be stored in a specific manner which makes these systmes fast and efficient. We need to learn about the basic data structures commonly used algorithms to process the data in those data structures to know what to use where and why. 

In this repo we will get started with the most basic data structures  like arrays, list, tuple and dictionary etc. We will implement more advanced data structures like queues, stacks and trees in python programming language. We will also look at some of the basic algorithms like search, sort and recursion etc
