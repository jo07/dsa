    "> Default sorting algorithm in python uses best of insertion sort which is good at sorting small sets and merge sort which is good at sorting long arrays. Timsort divides the array into bins of size min_run and sort them using insertion sort. We need to change the insertion sort algo a bit so that we can sort it on the same array instead of wasting memory by creating a new array. Then those bins are going to be put together using merge sort. Tada!!!"
