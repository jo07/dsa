    "> As the name implies, there is a bubble which goes from start to finish of a list, comparising or two adjacent elements. If those elements are not in correct order then the bubble swaps them and then move to the next step. It does this swaping thing, n times, n being the number of elements in the list to be sorted. As the bubble moves each time, it pushes the greatest element in the array to the last position, hence it doesn't compare it in the next iteration. So in each iteration, it compares one less element as it's already sorted."
